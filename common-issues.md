# Common Issues

This is a running list of common issues that users have run into:



_Problem: Some of the functions seem to work, others don't._

Solution: Make sure to sign up for the correct APIs and services through [AutoDesk Forge](https://forge.autodesk.com/).



_Problem: I can't create bucket "mybucket"._

Solution: Try a unique bucket name.



_Problem: I was able to create a bucket and upload a file, but I can't translate the file._

Solution: Each task requires different tokens with different scopes. Make sure to create a token with the "data:read data:write" scopes in order to translate a file.
